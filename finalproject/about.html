            <div class="paragraph"><p>Mustafa Ayman, 18 year old automotive
                photographer based in cairo. I started automotive
                photography in 2017 & I was shocked by the great
                results so I decided to improve my skills and
                continue in this carreer. Automotive photography is
                a self-taught skill I gained through time. Watching
                other people’s photographs was the best way to
                develop my skills in photography. I got inspired by
                (Renz.Jpg), his photographs are too simple but very
                sharp at the same time so I liked his work and
                started working on myself. After 5 years of
                automotive photography I’ve shot over 100 of
                luxurious and sports cars around egypt</p>
